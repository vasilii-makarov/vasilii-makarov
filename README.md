## About

C/C++ software engineer with 6+ years of commercial experience, working in teams of 2–20 people. 2+ years of experience team-leading a cross-functional team of up to 20 people. Built full-cycle development experience, from requirements gathering to implementation and customer demos.

In addition to core C++ development, I have strong experience building desktop user interfaces with **Qt** for production end-user applications. Passionate about modern C++ evolution and stay up to date with new language features and tooling. I enjoy hands-on prototyping and occasionally build small IoT projects, including an MQTT-based device integration.
